Drupal-Editor
=============

Allows you to post and edit articles on sites that use Drupal. You (or your Admin) have to enable the Blog API for this to work. On Drupal 7, you need to install the module "BlogAPI Alternative".
This is very unofficial, my only ties to Drupal is me using it for my webpage.

If you'd like to help just write an e-mail.
For more info or bug reports please send me a mail or go to my web page.

Get it on the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.dissem.android.drupal
