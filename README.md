*Warning:* this project is dead for different reasons:
- For my web page I switched from Drupal to Jekyll, so I just don't need it anymore
- It doesn't work properly on newer Drupal versions because it uses an obsolete API
- Google removed it from the Play store, apparently because it looked too much like an official Drupal App. I'm terribly sorry I made this impression, I really should have given the name and icon more thought. It was lazyness, not malice.

If someone wants to pick this up and make something with the code base, be my guest. But I think you'll be faster making a new app from scratch.


Drupal-Editor
=============

Allows you to post and edit articles on sites that use Drupal. You (or your Admin) have to enable the Blog API for this to work. On Drupal 7, you need to install the module "BlogAPI Alternative".
This is very unofficial, my only ties to Drupal is me using it for my webpage.

If you'd like to help just write an e-mail.
For more info or bug reports please send me a mail or go to my web page.

Get it on the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.dissem.android.drupal
